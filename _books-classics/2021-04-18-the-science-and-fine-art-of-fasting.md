- periods of enforced fasting, due to shipwreck, mine disasters, etc.
- On the colder days, these [animals] sleep and take no food. . . . This is to say, many animals that store away food in various caches fast much during the winter months.
- Hibernation is a dormant state of existence, accompanied by greatly diminished respiration, circulation and metabolism, in which animals in the temperate regions spend the winter. . . . During this period the animal functions are nearly suspended; the body heat is lowered to or nearly that of the air, the action of the heart is much reduced and the animal loses from thirty to forty percent of its weight. . . . During hibernation the mammal may not feed, depending entirely on the stored food reserves within the body.
