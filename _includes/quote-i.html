"<ul><p>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</p><p>— Ecclesiastees 1:1-2</p></ul><ul><p>The fratricide with which history begins was caused by envy and not by hunger.</p><p>— Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov</p></ul><ul><p>Great things are done when men and mountains meet; this is not done by jostling in the street.</p><p>— William Blake</p></ul>",
"<ul><p>The ability to perceive or think differently is more important than the knowledge gained.</p><p>— David Bohm</p></ul><ul><p>Once the transcendental anchorage is surrendered, the descent from the rational to the animal nature, so it seems, is inevitable.</p><p>— Eric Voegelin</p></ul><ul><p>I have seen it once, the one thing that my soul sought, and the perfection that we put somewhere far away above the stars, that we put off until the end of time—I have felt it in its living presence. There it was, all that is highest! in this circle of human nature and of things, it was there! I no longer ask where it may be; it was in the world, it can return into it, it is in the world now, only more hidden. I no longer ask what it is; I have seen it, have known it. O you who seek the highest and the best, whether in the depths of knowledge, in the turmoil of action, in the darkness of the past, in the labyrinth of the future, in graves or above the stars! do you know its name? the name of that which is one and is all? Its name is Beauty.</p><p>— Friedrich Hölderlin, Hyperion</p></ul>",

"<ul><p>Many times I spoke, and as a result felt sorry, but I never regretted my silence.</p><p>— Saint Arsenius</p></ul><ul><p>Those who read a lot and think a little read those who read a little and think a lot.</p><p>— Simon Ante</p></ul><ul><p>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p><p>— Matthew 15:11</p></ul>",
"<ul><p>Beauty is without utility because the latter is a pressing of a thing to other purposes, thus it indicates no perfection complete in itself. Hence the more useful things are, the more corners they show1, so to speak, as means to adapt themselves to other connections; the curve2 of a sphere is perfect in itself.</p><p>— Immanuel Kant, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime</p></ul><ul><p>A like fate awaits him, / The two rages commingle in a whirlpool.</p><p>— James Joyce, Ulysses</p></ul><ul><p>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin.</p><p>— Ecclesiastes 5:6</p></ul>",
"<ul><p>Those who read a lot and think a little read those who read a little and think a lot.</p><p>— Simon Ante</p></ul><ul><p>Everything is art, and art creates everything among men ... The power of art in human affairs is much greater than is that of nature ... Lucan was perhaps a greater genius than Virgil, but it does not mean that he was a greater poet, and more successful in his undertaking; rather, no one considers him even comparable to Virgil.</p><p>— Giacomo Leopardi</p></ul><ul><p>It is only ideas gained from walking that have any worth.</p><p>— F.N., Twilight of Idols</p></ul>",
"<ul><p>Those who read a lot and think a little read those who read a little and think a lot.</p><p>— Simon Ante</p></ul><ul><p>One writes as one reads.</p><p>— Leo Strauss</p></ul><ul><p>Intellect is the most continuous quality.</p><p>— Aristotle</p></ul>",
"<ul><p>Being a philosopher today means not to think, but a mimetic fascination with various philosophical masters; not private independence that at the same time works to advance the most universal interests of mankind, but a public profession that is almost forced to partake in the civilizational decay; not a solitary and even ascetic detachment, but plunging in the midst of the modern mimetic crisis.</p><p>— Simon Ante</p></ul><ul><p>Once the transcendental anchorage is surrendered, the descent from the rational to the animal nature, so it seems, is inevitable.</p><p>— Eric Voegelin</p></ul><ul><p>The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</p><p>— Ecclesiastes 2:14</p></ul>",

"<ul><p>The ability to perceive or think differently is more important than the knowledge gained.</p><p>— David Bohm</p></ul><ul><ul><p>After the Revelation, the error of the early Christians was just this, their conviction that everything was complete ... We are not capable of foreseeing the creative possibilities that this kind of deconstruction—the deconstruction of the old sacrificial system, the mimetic malaise of the crowd—produces. I think that we must examine our history and try to see whether, beneath what has already occured, there are not additional layers of phenomena waiting to be revealed; whether some aspects of life that used to be constrained by the old sacrificial system are not going to flourish, other domains of knowledge, other ways of living. Everything that the Passion undid in the cultural sphere might well be an opening, an extraordinary source of enrichment.</p><p>— René Girard</p></ul><ul><p>...the ancient battle between those who live for a cause and those who live off it, or between those who are the cause and those who represent it.</p><p>— A.S.</p></ul>",

The only real education is self-education.</p><p>— Simon Ante</p></ul><ul><p>It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.</p><p>— Alfred North Whitehead</p></ul><ul><p>Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god.</p><p>— Aristotle</p></ul>"
