An interesting question to consider: Has the blockchain ledger a beginning? In other words, has the blockchain ledger a “founding event?“ This is a difficult question, and must be considered from a vast array of viewpoints: be they strictly technical or even anthropologically theological.

Technical answer is downstream from the scientific paradigm of the pre- and Enlightenment era, by necessity carrying the whole baggage of it‘s metaphysics. The latter operates on a set of assumptions that we can no longer completely adhere to anymore. It may reject the ex nihilo hypothesis.

The Father [ En ] is causeless, has no first cause, no “founding event“ so to speak. 

What about the Son of Man, or “Un“? Is it as contingent and mortal as the “darkness,“ or the S-E sacred?

And upon making these considerations, where do we fit the whole technology of blockchain ledger?

Thinking about the meaning of technology is more important then ever, since the most foundational considerations are not much entertained, all while we are in the process of utilizing hitherto unprecedented powers of tech, with unimagined potentialities for irreversible and fatal second order effects. 

Every order to be regarded as the sacred must be founded on a S-E bedrock, or the “earthly first cause,“ which by reason of it‘s “sole-earthiness,“ it‘s being solely of “this world“ as S-E by necessity innitiates a chain of temporal events. Each founding bedrock — a murder — innitiates a cultural season, a temporality we can regard as history. If we are concerned with most troughout considerations ‚ meaning a recognition of the paramount primacy of the religious — we cannot forgo the prophetic dimension and the implied workings of destiny as the implacable course of the primary current. Short-sighted specialization and vanity is blind to the latter.

Tech as a tool of science: guided by scientific method, we can with plainly obvious mathemathical certainty prove and show that the blockchain ledger indeed has a “founding“ ledger: a S-E “first cause“.

Tech as _the organic_: the boundry between “nature“ and “technology,“ the “divine“ and the “wordly technology“ becomes obsolete and impossible. The tech becomes so imbedded in “nature,“ in our everyday fabric that two assumptions gradually become negated:
— a single authority can have a complete control over the technology.
— there can be a complete understanding of the technological network.
— we can live disengage and extricate ourselves from technology [ the realization of the undeniable evolutionary symbiosis of man—hand—tool. The evolutionary collaboration of the organic and the inorganic. ].

Tech turns from a clock machine that is simple to understand — as per the Enlightenment vision — to something more and more approximating and thus morphing with the nature of reality itself (incl. the organic). With the latter — if we are sincere — we cannot ever hope to establish a complete omniscience, know the first cause (unless we project a somewhat vain believe that we have such ability ).

By “organic tech“ I mean the alteration of the meaning and elemental character of technology itself such that it is no longer a tool instituted by a founding event in time and space. “Organic“ precisely since the conversion of technology to the realm of reality itself, joining the ranks of natural elements, geological phenomena, planetary phenomena etc. Or a hyperobject produced by what we call anthropocene.

Taking technology as a complex clock machine is no longer tenable. It is and will become as elemental and thus “indestructable“ as the formation of geological strata. We can destroy a clock machine, but we cannot in the same sense destroy the “organic“. My argument is that technology is increasingly approximating the latter.

Thus we can no longer think of technology as a domain managed by and only concerning engineers led by capitalist leaders. Technology is becoming as elemental as air [ e.g. IoT ]. Teilhardian noosphere is for no accident presented as something grandly elemental in evolution, and not a mere dataserver institution.

For this reason we need to approach technology not as engineers or some other foolish and frankly harmful stereotype like “left-brained analytical programmers“. No, we need to approach technology as human in a same way that we approach elemental and organic fresh air. 

This implies a fundamental change of the relationship between man and the machine. This relationship will be troublesome and awkward as long as we think of it as the relationship of the organic and the inorganic. This relationship must become the organic with the organic, must become elementally organic, must attain to the immanent primacy of movement. Lamentably, it seems that in the relative this relationship turns in an opposite direction: the supposed “user“ is less and less human, and takes on the present inorganicity of the machine/technology. 

Thus to return to our first question: has the blockchain ledger a beginning? The answer is yes if we take it as an inorganic and highly complex clock machine. The answer is no if we take it as organic. If the latter question turns out more true than the former, then this will have fascinating implications. For example, such “organic“ blockchain ledger could no longer avoid facing the religious.
