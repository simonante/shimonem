Unmellowed Thoughts

Simon Ante

2023

------

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of ADM, is the very raison-d'Ãªtre of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.
