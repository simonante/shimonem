Unmellowed Thoughts

Šimon Ephraim Matyáš

2023

------

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo. Tato logika sociálně aktivistické transcendence (mám na mysli aktivistická ve smyslu proroka, nikoli bombardéru) je ve svém nejširším uplatnění a božském záměru, jak se zdá, zaměřena na suverénní věc biblického: vyhladit zlo všech zla, zvané Smrt. Bible nám říká, že je to tento darebák, který přišel na svět s prvotním hříchem. A Pád člověka, אדם, je samotným raison-d'être Zákona, který svým rozlišením na to, co je dobré (např. láska k jedinému Bohu) a zlo (např. krádež, závist, cizoložství), spásná přikázání. a zákazy se snaží odradit ďábla, což umí nejpodivuhodněji, ale bohužel je téměř bezmocný tváří v tvář tomu strašlivě nestrannému soudci jménem Smrt. Proroci to věděli: zaslíbený mesiášský věk není ani výlučně vnitřní zbožností, ani univerzálním technicko-ekonomickým společenstvím, ale abychom zasáhli kořen zla, je třeba mesiášský věk, jeho hmatatelný charakter, hledat v tom viníkovi, v tom chlípném těle, které nemohou jinak než páchat zločin generací. (Pouze generace staví obílené hroby). Mesiáš, pokud má zvítězit nad zlem, kterým je smrt, musí být způsobem jedinečné rekapitulace kořenů a větví stvoření, jak se zdá, bezvadně počatým tělem. Osobní a duchovní tělo, neposkvrněné generačním zločinem, a historie dokazující platnost mesiáše, osobní tělo v celé své slabosti nekonečně silnější a přemáhající generace, v Ježíši, jako neposkvrněném synu Páně, dávajícím smrt na smrt. na kříži a při vzkříšení schvalujícím určitý druh triumfu, který se ve velmi narušeném procesu rozšíří na celé stvoření.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation.

Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin.

If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it.

Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.

The immortal composers got their celestial tunes from the Lord of Zion. The composer's piety makes him more attuned to His tunes of glory more than the mundane cacophony of the world. Look no further for the secret of the genius. Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Rather, absolutely do not at all direct that impious look at the mortal genius (which ruins and stifles greatnes, and makes but an epigone), but take the thorny shortcut to Lord himself. 
This is but one special instance of the logic of Zion, that ungeometrical logic of personal affection with God and neighbour, unhypocritically serving and honoring whitewashed sepulchres ex ante, or perhaps, amid present oblivion or derision of a true 'public' benefactor, being comforted by and looking forward to that wonderful mansion.
This logic of a socially activistic transcendence (I mean activistic in a sense of a prophet, not a bomber) is in its fullest application and divine design, so it seems, aimed at the sovereign cause of the biblical: to exterminate the evil of all evils, called Death. The Bible tells us that it is this rascal that came into the world with Original Sin. And the Fall of Man, of אדם, is the very raison-d'être of the Law, which, through its distinction of what is good (e.g. loving the One God) and evil (e.g. stealing, envy, adultery), salutary commandments and prohibitions seeks to defer the devil, which it can do most wonderfully but, alas, it is next to powerless in the face of that terribly even-handed judge called Death. Prophets knew this: the promised messianic age is neither an exclusively inward piety or a universal techno-economical commonweal, but, to strike the radix of evil, the messianic age, its palpable character, must be sought in that culprit, that lustful flesh, which cannot help but perpetrate the crime of generations. (Only generations erect whitewashed sepulchres). The Messiah, if he is to triumph over the evil, which is death must, in a way of singular recapitulation of creation root-and-branch, so it seems, be an immaculately conceived flesh. A personal and spiritual flesh, undefiled by the generational crime, and, history proving the validity of a messiah, a personal flesh in all its weakness infinitely stronger and overpowering generations, in Jesus, as an immaculate son of Lord, giving a death to death on the cross, and in resurrection ratifying a kind of triumph that will, in a very perturbed process, spread to all creation.

Nesmrtelní skladatelé dostali své nebeské melodie od Pána Sionu. Skladatelova zbožnost ho činí více naladěným na Jeho melodie slávy než všední kakofonie světa. Nehledejte dál tajemství génia. Spíše vůbec nesměřujte ten bezbožný pohled na smrtelného génia (který ničí a dusí velikány a dělá z něj epigona), ale vezměte ožehavou zkratku k samotnému Lordovi. Toto je jen jeden zvláštní příklad logiky Sionu, ona negeometrická logika osobní náklonnosti k Bohu a bližnímu, nepokrytě sloužící a ctící obílené hroby ex ante, nebo možná, uprostřed současného zapomnění nebo posměchu skutečného „veřejného“ dobrodince, je utěšována. a těšíme se na to nádherné sídlo.

The infertility of modern philosophy coincides with its simultaneous abandonment of poetry and theology. It is a soothing repast of mentally alienated minds who no longer respond to eschatological problems, but flounder in abstract and unpoetical mazes of self-therapy, epigones weaned on some name-sake dead thinking personages (they adore whitewashed tombs), whether it is cloaked as philology, historical studies, sociology, psychology, etcetera.

You must sharpen and clarify your writing strain, reconcile jarring ideas and attitudes, cravenly insulated, hiding from that frightful possibility of discovering the secret identity of the warring foes.

Murky distress written and transmogrified onto crystalline clarity: t'is wonderful alchemy.

A sense for the weather's vicissitudes in that inclement realm of human relations. Even before language waxing alef bet, I could palpably feel through that flimsy air the clusterfactured nonsense hitting the spirit's iron plate, for t'is battle for Zion, not peace.

What absolutely contradicts that kind of reason which almost conceitedly thinks itself above religion, is the quite mysterious thorough lack of reason in the very act of emulation. Reason is blind to this eerie fact, though while it may be completely possessed by it. By far nothing equals religion, more specifically the biblical, in dealing with this precarious and implacable irrationality of any act of emulation. If the creation is likened to an ocean, and the creatures thereof to so many swarming and gregarious fishes, than the ocean is religion and it's God is far above its restlessly foaming and billowing surface. It is the God 'far off,' as the lacrymose prophet once called it.

The crass indelicacy of some environments is as a sharp razor to a delicate consciousness.

Every nonsense has its origin in cluster-mindedness, by which it is consequently sustained and bigotly defended. But let such a nonsense be qualified only as a man-wrought (anthropocetric) nonsense: one can conscientiously vouch for as a partisan bigot only for a divinely revealed nonsense.
