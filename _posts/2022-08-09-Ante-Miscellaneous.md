Miscellanies 

by Simon Ante


01

The never ending mortal wrangle,
Who can save us from this
Mortal odyssey bitter-sweet?

02

It would be interesting to study and array the basic identical premise of all Enlightenment thinkers with which they justify their efforts toward a better, more enlightened future. It always goes along the semi-Pelagian lines that man or the benighted multitude is not corrupt and unrectifiable, but caught in a senseless superstition and, to paraphrase Kant, a “self-caused bondage of mind.” That this endeavor was a failure, as exemplified from the second half of the nineteenth to the first half of the twentienth century, should be a very telling indication in the examination of why people don’t want or are incapable of the enlightenment. It should also elucidate the impossibility of rationalizing religion or even doing away with it, in so far as ‘the religious’ is seen as an ineradicable part and parcel of society and human reciprocity—whether the context is expressly ecclesial or secular.

03

What is fashioned as an intellectual “discovery” in some thinker is nothing but giving a new form to a truth that was already known before. It is the same mind getting to know itself each generation anew. Older generations are the older young generations, and every revolution becomes an institution.

04

On one side, the paternal warmth and anchorage of orthodoxy and tradition,
A petrified truth that fears any creative movement soever. On other side, a madness and lawlessness meet,
That strikes the chords of passion hard,
And drinks the sap of creation to the bottom deep.
The mad discord eviscerates the stately element of man.
Keeping up life betwixt the two camps.

05

When the Old Adam suffers affliction in this world, he is corrupted; when the New Adam suffers, he is purified. And we shal follow the latter archetype, so thus, so it seems, the God wills it.

05

The fiendish clan of engineers,
Spun about their fellow men
A webs of algorithmic hell.
A covert directors of shadowy destinies.

04

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But life is not a geometric affair, it is a theo-drama.

05

The problem of thinking. Proudhon put it well that if people did not think critically the society would function smoothly like a beehive, and that only by incorporating thinkers the social fabric is disturbed; a similar conception of an economic hue is found in Voeblen, who envisages a society that perfectly conforms to its technological mechanisms, and is free from the disrupting entepreneurs who always destroy this technological order qua the mechanism of society upon which order of society largely depends, by innovation; a typical modern double bind of order and innovation. I concur with the idea of Matthew Arnold that individuals best worship comunally but philosophize alone. This leads to Leo Strauss, to which a homage must be paid by making explicit the idea of hiding truth, and especially its being a function of political responsibility: a sort of win-win both for the security and peace of the larger (unthinking) public and the intellectual sanctum of the one inclined to think. So there is no some gnostic arcana that need to be shielded by a straussian front; rather these are simple (albeit piquant) truths which are not given to all. Thinking and the intellect is that realm that seems to be by nature aristocratic in a very stubborn way. This creates some problems in the democratic age when equality is put on pedastal. Tocqueville had a precious observation that intellect may be the last aristocratic vestige in an age that succeded to dispense with the aristocratic order and its hereditary entitlements. 
Thinking is inherently elitarian, and for reason a cardinal anathema of every despot who first seeks to ban literature. But thinking is stubborn and in a sense antifragile. The more you beat it the stronger it gets. Throw the intellect in the prison cell, and it writes a book or a manifesto. Execute it, and even if it had no opportunity or inclination to write down its ideas, it has affected strongly enough those few who will do the work of propagation (e.g. Socrates, Christ etcetera).

The orientation away from God and toward the intramundance-secular sphere of the moderns, with their mutilated messianism, must have forgot the old rule of Mencius: "Those who espouse deviant views must be prevented from putting them into effect, for what is effected in the mind causes harm in affairs, and what is implemented in affairs causes harm to government."

05

Freedom is for cowards. It takes courage to conform. But there is an intelligent and a stupid kind of conformity. The stupid one is born of fear, the intelligent out of understanding.

06

Like an ocean wave, the idealist rolls smoothly in his pensive reverie before getting crushed by the reefs of reality.

07

Temporal human relationships are endowed with the sacred. The so-called "genius" or the "saint' is a desacralizing force. It is thus alienated from human relationships that are temporal. It can only thrive in a refined relationship with the past, to wit, Holy Writ, literature. As a citizen of centuries to come, he can speak to his contemporaries only from the past. Formal rules and objectivity are the childs of temporary reciprocity. When dipped and immersed in the restive flood of temporary reciprocity, formal objectivity and lawless subjectivity are made out of different stuff. When propituously alienated from temporary human relationships ("protected" (aristocracy)), when one convenes with the past as if present (via the medium of language and literature, the desacralizing force dealing heretic blows to all temporary sacredness and mortal awkwardness of time), the subjectivity soars to the status of the objective (id est, free spirited morality, purchased at the price of ascetism and devotion to perfect beauty).

08

Viewed from a distance, everything is beautiful.
— Tacitus

The historian in his withdrawn enclave loves mankind, those that have to do with mankind on everyday bases hate it.

09

There is nothing more unjust than a justice-seeking mob.

10

In the last analysis, every revolution is a reshuffling of elites, and never their annihilation. Revolutions are wild elitism.

11

The kind of efficiency that corrodes the spirit is anathema.

12

They were so economical that they sold the spirit.

13

Who shall decide when doctors disagree? Who will guard the warden? The personalistic (Christian) exception.

14

Thinking is inherently elitarian, and for reason a cardinal anathema of every despot who first seeks to ban literature. But thinking is stubborn and in a sense antifragile. The more you beat it the stronger it gets. Throw the intellect in the prison cell or intermitent camp, and it writes a book or a manifesto. Execute it, and even if it had no opportunity or inclination to write down its ideas, it has affected strongly enough those few who will do the work of propagation (e.g. Socrates, Christ etcetera).

15

If I were to describe the final and fundamental life-orientation or world-view of mine, it would be most aptly captured along the line “keeping it all in the mind.” 
One can think up new ideas and compose music even if one is blind and deaf: this is the principle of the life of the mind, and consequently of immortality, namely, “keeping it all in the mind.”

16

Purely mental music composition, the other inmortal side of the life of the mind.

17

The fundamental aim of all composition—whether of ideas or sounds (purely in the life of the mind)—is not the most appropriate and fitting response to the spirit of the times (which may go so far as to even require the sacrifice of beauty, for instance in the surrealist attitude partially, and the dadaist altogether. Rather, the true aim in composition is the unconditional pursuit of the beautiful, under the vertical pressure of the religious inspiration (piety, faith), even at the price of confronting the spirit of the times. Christ is the arch-model of ‘holy eccentricity,’ and consequently the first teacher of all true fine artists.

18

Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times: that savage temporal despot. Tacitus was right when he said "they call it the spirit of the age to corrupt and to be corrupted." Eccentricity in interaction with others is absolutely necessary to preserve the truth; alse the chameleon takes on the unpalatable hue of the prevalent Zeitgeist, the temporal wickedness. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man." Holy eccentricity.

19

‘Future’: a construct made by the benighted many which has no clue that what it really designates is the desert.

20

A lifetime habit of waking up very early is the closest to retaining the eternal youth and immortality all through life. The empyrean generation wakes with the lark.
Another way 

21

The feeling of aristocratic youth—whatever the age—whenever warped in a clean, freshly washed and ironed attire.

22

In her I saw that fine and high purity, that formal and kempt exquisite mien that moves with all the grace of poetic Passion. She sat there in her eternal feminine, supple and lithe, in a light ironed long-sleeve blouse, sat there before a fine piano keyboard.


23

“What makes these old Greek bards cry about the miseries of old age?” thinks a youth like myself. Eternal youth, eternal immortality! It is all in the spirit and not the flesh! I may grow physically old but grow lighter, more beautiful, more supple, more wise, more mellow, and hence younger in the true sense of that much spoiled world—younger in spirit. According to the master St. Thomas, "the soul’s faculty of understanding needs no bodily organ, the understanding itself is not weakened, neither essentially nor incidentally, either by old age or by any other weakness of body. Of course, hearking back to the great man Aristotle, who made the intellect the most continual quality.

24

The communion of the creature and its transcendental Maker, for example, exemplified in Psalm 119:73: “Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.”

25

The more grand and complex the goal of our striving, the greater the chance of entanglement in means. Nothing is more deplorable and pitiful than entanglement in the worldly compexities, and nothing sweeter than the bare simplicity of a devout and pious life.

26

The historians compose and ensemble fleeting events into a fine narrative that is no different from art, and it edifies intellectualy also. 

27

In saints and mystics I find the sweet residue and repository of the Edenic nectar.

28

The Passion is a contemplation of the lethal truth, beholding the scandalized human frenzy as it plays out but without losing God (“they know not what they do”).

29

On a half-hesting and half-serious note:

There comes the profound moment of contemplation, that ancient anamnetic experience wherewith the alpha and omega of it all is understood. And I don’t give a jot for all the majority of benighted men of this world; whatever they know they can keep (progress, pleasure, efficiency, etcetera); I have found that for which all men seek; thus I no longer seek, in arhatic melancholy I become more gentle and finished in this life; dedicating my will to God, and submitting to the highest vocation that He designates: that of a free and deliberate exposure to the dark wickedness of this world—evermore untainted and pious.

30

The aim is to live the longest possible life with a consciousness most ‘protected’ in all its delicacy and sensitivity. A life that is long, and whose pleasures are the highest and the most sublime, but free of the see-saw terror of the romantic passion. To be frank, I don’t want to bear or even hang on the cross, but all have to bear it willy-nilly in varying degrees.

31

The struggle in language is not different from the basic struggle of human relationship (primary reciprocity). They are both a crucible of confusion, mimetic frenzy, creativity, violence and bigotry, wisdom and sophistry, but also love and poetry. Christ enfolds all the members, as does the Word all language. That Word is (the all-enfolding) ‘I am’ of God, and Christ is the principal archetype of a brilliant form in a world of marred and corrupted forms. All true artists those follow Christ, as do the saints who through their ascesis mimic the perfect taking-form of the impalpable (archetypal) Perfection in a palpable form.

All true artists those follow Christ, as do the saints who through their ascesis mimic the perfect taking-form of the impalpable (archetypal) Perfection in a palpable form.

In the fourth century Gregory of Nyssa wrote of asceticism as a repetition of Christ’s original “taking-form,” the act by which he fashioned “a beauty in accord with the character of the Archetype” [primary movement in its truth! Not an entity but a movement, cf. Bortoft] and made of himself an “image of the invisible God.” And Schelling: "To represent an infinite content...a content which really resists form, which seems to destroy any form—to represent such an infinite content in the most perfect, that is, in the most finite form, that is the highest task of art."

33

Every true fine artist is driven by the same religious motive as that which characterizes Christianity in the proper, namely, the arduous and toilsome attempt (in some artists, particularly of the romantic kind, even a compulsion) to concretize the Perfection of God in this spoiled world. Both are an endeavour of an immensely courageous and mettlesome kind, which implies an incessant trial and affliction in relation to the imperfections and senseless arbitrariness of this world—moral, aesthetic, etcetera. But it must be said that the only true and the purest fulfillment of this religious endeavour is essentially in ascetism, catholoreciprocal charity and pure platonic love towards the other; a pity, understanding and compassion toward the evil and wickedness of this world—both in myself and the other (the spoiled and barbaric love (religious-reciprocal fascination, interpersonal divinization of a fallen reciprocity alienated from God). Fine artistry is essentialy the same endeavor, that is, the order or perfection or beauty that the creator wishes to evoke in the other. Though it is always inferior, however brilliant the painting of Boticelli or the sonata of Bach. But art, just like the saints and pious Christians, cannot but must be in this world—God requires that salt be added to an otherwise blant creation. 
Every perfect artist or a thinker is first a saint and an ascetic. A profound mind or a profound opus is preceded by a profoundly ascetic flesh [Un]. I think it is a mistaken creation lacking the deepest religious integrity (though it may be exquisite also!) when the creating person puts the artistic creation as the priority, and any inner ascesis and piety is either a secondary matter or outright dismissed. True fine artist is a saint who gets a little creative. 
Simone Weil said it in a more graceful brevity: "There exists a focal point of greatness where the genius creating beauty, the genius revealing truth, heroism, and holiness are indistinguishable."

34

To be overly lucid in this world is to have a basic problem to interact with the world. This problem will never go away, though one may learn to deal with it a trifle better. It is an unrealizable fancy to seek from such lucid stance a good accomodation to this world. For He told us that by following Him we are not of this world.

35

And it could be also said that the mathematician or even some engineers are driven by the religious idea of interpreting, manipulating or incarnating the perfect order (number or a devised orderly mechanism or program) to the unorderly world. Though it is more of a l’esprit géométrie than finesse.

36

Politics is the art of the possible, religion that of the impossible.

37

In a sense, God wants us to be imperfect because He sees through every pretense and prefers the spiritually candid man.

38

In retrospect, one may wonder why did the modern literary criticism expanded so much energy on something that is quite easy to comprehend and in the final analysis can be left as it is: the essential wickedness of a fallen humanity. The modern literary criticism, if it were less confused, that is to say modern, would more likely drop the pen and flight to the cloister.

39

The life of most people is a perpetual divertissement: work, pleasure, work, distraction, ad nauseam.

40

Ascetism is simply a perpetual keeping of the house clean so one can always receive God.

41

In God I find the native spring of all the joys that I seek in fine arts, refinement, and philosophy, with the exception that this joy, in its incomparable purity and continuity, is not a mere episode but a permanent sanctity.

42

Men are like pervese ants: they must always do something, make simple things complex, corrupt everything innocent, fill all emptiness with stuff, all silence with sounds, ever seeking new divertissements, new hopes and fears to harbor; in short, conforming to the will that rules this world over. Schopenhauer was right. "...all men, as they pass, mastered by desire, shoot an alluring arrow of the eye at the delicate beauty of virgins" (Aeschylus).

43

Any creative endeavour that lets one stray from the sanctity of ascesis is to be avoided. Create only from that undefiled ascesis and holiness, for only thus one purveys God most sincerly.

44

Maybe, it is all simple, really. Behind all my dreams and contemplations of beauty is God, and I may save myself many a tortuous fate if I just go straight to Him.

45

I am profoundly aware that, notwitstanding my earnest intentions, I still fall short of most comprehensibly fostering my life in the most limpid cultivation of classical art and literature (piety, philosophy, theology, classical literature, classical music). I have some source of pure intent from all the solitude that I’m privileged to enjoy, but I have a realistic sense that by being sometimes by necessity forced to get plunged in a benighted and unauthentic social climes, some of the sheer pure joy in the pursuit of those arts is lost. One has to be very strong spiritually, and perhaps even little insane, so to speak, to have the resolve and daring to be at odds with the prevalent time. But I need to recognize that this, if driven by the purest intent, that is, in closeness to God, is not the kind of vain and affectatious eccentricity, but an eccentricity of a holy kind, the one that is different from the wickedness of this world, the kind of pure and authentic eccentricity of Christ.

46

Setting the vision of the Heavenly Jerusalem dangerously close to terra firma, and stressing God’s transcendence more than human corruption

47

Whenever I see or hear a group of people doing some wicked thing, such as engaging in some absurdity or shouting, I always see some traces of sacred ritual, and even of disguised blood-letting intent. These are the remnants, alas still numerable in our time, of those mythical mobs alienated from God since the foundation of the world. But the (so-called) saints tread the steps of the Lamb.

48

Once I emancipate from the complexity of technology in general and the digital technology in particular, by radically simplifying to the most elementary first principles (the Platonic internet), and make the whole experience as utterly organic and graceful a technology as a violin or a wooden table (seamless and mobile e-ink, etcetera).

49

A silent reasoning threads along the line:
“Maybe I should be less perfect since others
Are so imperfect.” Wrong! Assimilation is not
Inevitable! Long live holy eccentricity.

50

I have a deep respect and admiration for the concept of classical schools (“gymnasium”). But this institution of ideal classical cultivation is bound to suffer, not unlike the Church, although in its own secular way. The one attempts to cultivate the mind and spirit, the other the life of faith and charity; but both do so in a rather deeply imperfect world—the former perhaps only implicitly, the rathet is more explicit. Here, the distinction between the religious and the secular does not matter, for men are wicked whether or not they attend church or classrooms. In theory, both these institutions—the Church and the gymnasium (and some univeristy departments too)—ought to be a bulwark against the maladies of the age, or even the desptism of the Zeitgeist—be it an atheist, totalitarian, amoral, philistine, or sophist maladies. Granted, these institutions can and do awake few individuals to the essence of all this education, that is, the traditional spirit in its purest and most perfect: classical excellence, grace, charity, refinement, piety. But the reality seems to be that in general these institution lose their faith against the prevalent age, nay are swamped by it. However much these institutions attempt to incentivize and help foster a cultivation of the mind, of the moral spirit, of piety, etcetera, the soil it cultivates is almost immediately spoiled once the mind returns to its habitat, the prevalent clime of the age. There, whatever is cultivated comes to naught, for the soil is marred by all the pestilent influences of the prevalent times, infused to this soil, and rather than the plants of piety and classical refinement and brilliance there sprout weeds with a false pretense of cultivation. 

51

There really is some credence to the idea of what I may tentatively call an arhatic completion. Maybe, at a certain point, it is no longer proper to seek anymore; maybe to do so would only evince confusion and restlessness. Maybe I don’t search for truth anymore, for I am conviced I have already found it. The truth, God, Beauty, holiness, ascetic simplicity ... it is all there when I am alone and content. **Maybe the primary task is no longer a search, but a certain perpetual keeping of the house clean so I can always receive God, and no longer be alienated from Him. ...Certain ascetism, silence and withdrawal from the social furore and confusion?** 
It is all there, and when I have the withdrawn patience and silence, I can maintain this blessedness even in the midst of social confusion. 
Beyond this point, I don’t search anymore. I can renounce the need to reciprocate and assert myself in social intercourse. It is all about patience and waiting, for to condescend out of (reciprocal) restlessness would be to consent to expedience, mediocrity of my work, insensitivity, senseless complexity that only disguises confusion, etcetera. Not to give to any of this, and in all impecability withstand all those social storms, like Christ. I said elsewhere that those who create the finest works of art—I mean those beacons of light that shine in their perfection and beauty so bright because such standard of perfection is so uncommon (holy eccentricity; a good kind of alienation from the prevalent spirit of the times)—are those who have the gift of patience; that is, not to give in to imperfection or wickedness or mediocrity, and wait for the right moment, and when that moment comes, effuse all one’s heart to it and produce a masterpiece. 
It is all about cultivating and protecting the sanctuary of the mind, its subtlety, sensitivity, wit, moral tact, spiritual inspiration, etcetera. Cultivation and protection: these are of paramount importance. The opposite would be the most deadly, and this is what usually produces and perpetuates the very malady of the prevalent spirit of the times (which, to not be too short-sighted, is but the general Original Sin): little or none cultivation, and an unrestrained openness to the outside world, to internal mediation, interpersonal polytheism or monotheisms in the social jungle (institutionalism, messaging, social media—all the technological terrorism on consciousness) or in other words, everything extramundane, worldly and what in the last analysis constitutes “the secular” itself—the technology, science, economics, psychologism, biologism, etcetera.


Hölderlin's incomparable locus classicus: "I have seen it once, the one thing that my soul sought, and the perfection that we put somewhere far away above the stars, that we put off until the end of time—I have felt it in its living presence. There it was, all that is highest! in this circle of human nature and of things, it was there! I no longer ask where it may be; it was in the world, it can return into it, it is in the world now, only more hidden. I no longer ask what it is; I have seen it, have known it. O you who seek the highest and the best, whether in the depths of knowledge, in the turmoil of action, in the darkness of the past, in the labyrinth of the future, in graves or above the stars! do you know its name? the name of that which is one and is all? Its name is Beauty."

52

Autodidactism does or does not work precisely because the orthodox discipline either can or cannot wed with the free and independent learning. In the end it is all a question of the character. Certainly, autodidactism is not a universal formula, for that would in a sense negate the its idea and all that constitutes it and is hard or impossible to pin down and normalize—unpredictability, non-linearity, learning from heart, even some daring and courage, etcetera. Unilinear curriculum and a sense of security provided by credentialism and institutional auspices is just something that most people will find more suitable.

53

The salvation I seek in fine art properly belongs to an ascetic life devoted to God. But that does not mean a complete neglect of arts, rather, to never put the salvation they provide on a higher pedastal than the one provided directly by God. Only when I am at home, grounded with God, only then I can properly create anything.

54

One can ask with Christ: is the (characteristically modern) endeavor to perfect this world worthwhile if it means to sell one’s soul? Christ never tried to immanentize the Kingdom of God, he was not a socialist or a political messiah in the modern sense. He always insisted that those who follow Him are not of this world. "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"

55

Curiosity is a legible human impulse, but all too often, to seek may imply confusion and mimetic restlessness in disguise. Our culture heals praise on the never ending search, but in so doing it may, perhaps very intentionaly, be overlooking the deadly truth. Beyond certain “arhatic” threshold, call it a damascene conversion or whatever, the more important vocation is not seeking, as much as protection. It seems counterintuitive, but one needs to experience that to withstand in self-effacing patience and silence and suffering, without the need to assert oneself or retort or reciprocate (what would amount to wickedness), to thus withstand the many wicked social episodes, is sometimes more effective way of “seeking” than to plunge oneself into the world. In so doing, although it will certainly never seem as such while bearing the pains of such patient self-effacement and silence, one nonetheless need have faith as the evidence of the unseen joy and contentment that inevitably follows once the furore billows of the social delirium (the remains of the sacred) abate (and they always abate). This is the only way to ward and protect the sanctuary of consciousness.

56

What if the love I feel for a mortal feminine does not requit? What if I become blind, or all books (including the computers) are burnt? What if I lose my hand with which I play violin or pianoforte? What if I become deaf and can no longer listen to and cherish classical pieces? What a state of atrocious misery would I end up in once this thing in which I place and find all salvation simply does not requit the attention, time, and foremost the love I give it, or what if it becomes unrealizable any longer? Granted, maybe not every man loses his hand or becomes blind, and perhaps there are even such fortunate mortals who find the love toward other human being requited, and then sustained and ever re-vitalized till the end of days. But still, I shall never wed myself to these things too closely, even if I occasionally play the instrument, or love somebody. I will always see all these mortal and perishable and contingent things as something alien, for once I find that same love in a much purer, and actually the original way it was meant, that is, a pure relation to God, I no longer feel the attachment to these things that would make the divorce from them a painful experience. I don’t mean a complete rejection of everything of this world, for these things are given to us to be made good use of by God himself, and He wills it so. But we only make the mistake that we get too distracted by his gifts, and forget the Author who freely gave us such blessing. I will cherish those gifts, but only when I am certain in my relationship to Him. When I feel disconected from Him and hence unsure, I will never commit the mistake of instead finding solace and love in those things of the world, but rather stop, and in silent prayer find Him again. Only then I can do anything in thos world. Amen.

57

Strike the vital chord, this palpitating verve of life; 
It soundeth a silver-toned timbre bright.
These ancient instruments of grace and poetry fine,
A curse to all modern contraptions of might and efficiency foul.

58

One must bear fleshly pains to be cleansed.

59

These men unwittingly poured more fire to the heated odium theologicum, the self-destruction of Christianity. If an impartial child of solid intelligence were presented with this mise-en-scene, it would undoubtedly, prima facie, intuit the absurd folly and tragedy of this situation.

60

Flaunting his wit to catch the popular ear.

61

The romantic is short on longevity, long on passion;
The wise thinker the opposite.

62

The pretentious whistling in the dark of modernity.

63

As one pays the homage of traditional-spiritual-intellectual-cultural continuity to another bygone thinker by giving the effort to interpret his ideas, so one pays an equally honorable due to a bygone composer by playing his pieces with precise care and ardent passion. Unless the consciousness revives the greatness of the past into its present beholding awareness (an endeavour that cannot do without the Platonic experience of anamnesis), we can hope for nothing less noble than a society of barbarous and crude clime in which the spirit forgets the ancient founts of vital revival.

64

Against modernity, we oppose not traditionalism or reactionism, which are also forms of the ‘modern,’ but the tradition and spirit of continuity.
(Guillaume Faye)

65

The fine artist is necessarily out of the haste of efficiency and progress, for the essence of art consists in incessant refinement and sculpting of the ideal work, whose ideality would become degraded by haste.

66

Whatever you write don’t publish immediately. Like the wine, it must first prove its worth with time.

67

The Christian revelation [of the sacred myth] is not supposed to destroy transcendence [an assumption that validates intramundane modernity as a its logical historical consequence], but rather to do away with the type of transcendence furnished by the sacred violence and reconciliation [on the head of an innocent lamb]. The revelation and the desecralization of the sacred myth does not direct at an intramundane, secularized realm [confused as the secular eschaton]; in its complete comprehension it directs at a new form of desacralized transcendence, the one coterminus with the Holy Trinity [the unity of implicate and explicate orders in a primary-archetypal movement].

68

Modern philosophy inclines to Gnosticism precisely because of its tacit rejection, and perhaps even a fear, of the foolish Christian idea that all men need to be saved. The very idea of Gnosis rejects this notion. Perhaps gnosis is necessary in a world in which the majority (and perhaps almlst all) of men are benighted and alienated from God. Perhaps, if all men were to share in God via the Holy Trinity [En—Un], to wit, the Kingdom of God, would there still be a necessity for gnosis?

69

The archetypal-Ur-primary movement of unfoldment—enfoldment is a human reciprocity that is inherently of a religious hue, irrespective of the extramundane- or intramundane-oriented milieu in which it moves. The enfolding of human reciprocity is love or identity—whether its more barbaric form (violence) or more graceful and charitable (caritas). Human community left to itself (human community as it has developed evolutionary in nature over millenia) is capable only of an enfolding reciprocity that established order and concord at the price of a furtively slain innocent victim. This human reciprocity, through mythical religions of the sacred, has found its transcendence and assurance of order _only_ at the expense of a hidden founding violence.
Thinking as such is itself a primary (and when tapped deeply a truly impersonal) movement of enfolding (insight) and unfolding (formation of ideas). What love is in the human relationship, insight is in thinking. 

70

Creative discipline consists of a kind of higiéne mimétisme which is a sort of divine naïvete necessary to tap—always inferiorly—what Christ tapped in his Passion when emptied out to His Father.

71

What is that inexplicable logic behind those ensembles deemed fine and high? Is it not a higiéne mimétisme, a peculiar enlightened naïvete that can only by this unencumbered lightness [an immense and boundless clearness, indeed, almost like that otherworldly lucidity found on the death-bed] truly burst forth those witty and angelical poetic ensembles, that then, once all this effulgence and effusion is brought (unfolded) out (under the Passion instigated by higiéne mimétisme), it stands for those mainstay cultural artefacts studied and played by all the worker-bees (those who only practice and elaborate upon existing forms) that don’t allow themselves the luxury, or rather are not strong enough to withstand this almost ascetic discipline, of indulging in the higiéne mimétisme necessary for attaining that peculiar knowledge of the one who creates something that is unlike those who merely behold completed artefacts of others.
...
There is a time to be attentive to the wisdom of other mellow minds, to imbibe the skill and insight without which any creative activity lacks timbre and formal grace; and a time to shun all that, and allow the hitherto dormant fount to burst forth freely, to borrow a beautiful expression Schelling, represent an infinite content that resists and indeed wants to destroy all the confines of a form [Un], in a form that is as fine and enrapturing as it is finite (all fine and high art is therefore an inferior imitation of the fine and high art embodied in a human form, Christ).

Taciturnity and silence, bordering on the enigmatically mystical, is the right intuition and a necessary mode of being-in-the-social-world. This intuition grasps rightly that occupation with religious-spiritual matters in the social context (suffused as it is with mimetic (sacred) behavior conducive to confusion, social awkwardness and lethal distortion) is a very precarious and dangerous endeavour. Man must be wholly concerned with these grave religious-spiritual matters, and it is very unfortunate if, rightly disgusted by all the ills that surge up whenever these matters take on a more explicit social significance, he abandons these questions and preoccupations as nonsensical, and submits to the so called pragmatic reality of this world.==


73

The cardinal virtue and merit of mysticism is the shunninh of explicitness. Being too explicit can become a sin. To conceal not as vulpine cunning, but as the protection of that which gives birth to explicitness per se. The condition is barbaric and vile wherever explicitness dominates, forgets and becomes alienated from its hearth and its origin.

74

Society and its institutional machinations will furnish you with a needless plenty of material affluence, titles, degrees and privileges. The Western civilization has advanced so far that even the most ignorant con can enjoy these run-of-the-mill, copy-paste prerogatives. But however much we may boast about our political or economic freedoms, the sheer array of available consumer goods, our liberal democracy, the technological progress, etcetera, etcetera... we, as a society, still miss the only one true privelege: to think. We tend to fall under a peculiar belief that so far as there are no repressive regimes, there are no remaining privileges to conquer. Though it may seem at a superficial first impression queer, even in the most democratic and liberal society the privilege of thinking may be still as rare as freedom of physical movement under an opressive regime.
But the whole matter is complicated by a one stubborn fact, almost a universal law, that clashes with the modern revolutionary principles (I take the whole movement of modernity in its basic character as such to be revolutionary, insofar as it need a distance, nay even has a certain trauma of the traditional authority): something like thinking, which is inherently a province and a privilege of few, cannot be democratized, else a peculiar confusions and awkwardness and simulacra of thinking ensue—with few exceptions as embodied in the majority of universities.

75

Those seemingly insignificant acts of acquiescence to that subtle social pressure: it is those that insidiously ruin and mutilate one's life as such.


76

Holy anamnsesis, a blessed remembrance,
Ferret out the hidden recessess of the mind.
I see one mind, only one.

77

The fatal error that negates Marxism is the good-intentioned, but in the end catastrophic attempt to equate and let mingle the intellect with the most concrete and practical matters of mundane living. It cannot but lead to intellectual corruption and desacration.

78

Finding a religious solace in modern poets is vanity.

79

The more ye mingle in temporal wrangles, the more you’re sapped of universality.

80

Negative purity over positive weal.

81

What am I supposed to feel when, in the conversation with an old person, purported to be wise, he rather boasts in vanity? He shares not impersonal and universal bits of wisdom, but rather gives out some of his panoply of honors and experience. What I observe in conversation with old people that as a yet young and inexperienced, but profound mind, I always resort to very abstract and universal musings, whereas the older ones keep coming to concrete experiences. But I keep encountering a certain species of the age, which, rather than representing some ancient wisdom tradition or being an authentic priest or rabbi, is rather of the more pragmatic, worldly, modern, immanentist kind.

82

Music as a metaphor, indeed a critical element of primary harmony (or discord) that is highly contagious. Music, in a contagious-cultural sense, is a religious and political factor.

83

The true find artist does not bother about the reception of his work, does not allow it to influence or dictate his free creative effort. The moment he responds to the audience he is more like the prince or the businessman.

84

In this unfinished strife of history, it is the grossest error to affectiously take the pose of peace—a peace that betrays strain and tension, and perhaps even a vague intuition of its untruth. Truly, a most integral artillery is necessary. Take in the falconet of ancient wit, the shooting iron of classical compositions, the political and diplomatic artifice, Hebrew foresight, Hindu concentration,... How can you fight this war with a hammer only? You need it all.

85

O! This history, this movement, I ask, what is it? A movement of envy, passion, wickedness—commenced by fratricide. And many are thereat, ensnarled in that welter of confusion and pretense, that eat and drink, plunged in multiplicity of divertissements. And all these, as the scripture told and foretold, are swept out by the fiery billows of wickedness. Only few are aware, only few are animated by a true religious passion, only few possessed of a discipline of intellectual integrity.

86

To grasp the inmost nuance of language, of thinking, of classical composition: this is the acme of life.

87

I cannot ever imagine esconcing in the prevalent social order, having a spouse, leading an animalistic, utilitarian life furnished with divertissements, narrow-minded to the mere confines of family, etcetera. It is the most piteous sort of existence—though that does  not mean it is not the most ideal one for the majority (though here I say this without Gnostic vanity (a merely reason up wickedness?)).

88

The kind of mutiny that can sprout from a vital and vigorous intellect unyoked by the inconspicuous good will of tradition. 

89

Generally, people seem to eventually arrive at a vague intuition of the arbitrariness of their action and general orientation in life. This is perhaps the closest that people get to the recognition of mimetic desire.

90

Political implications of autodidactism.

91

Much of prevalent culture and art embodies a total failure to attain to the heights of the high culture of yore. This is cleverly disguised by the merit of idiosyncrasy, alternative approaches or the newfangled, albeit not necessarily graceful technologies.

92

To hurry is vulgar. Haste and grace wed terribly.

93

Applied philosophy (pragmatism), applied science (technology), applied messianism (political religions), applied Christianity (Kantian morality)... all these are unthinkable without the modern enterprise of immanetization.

94

There is a sense in which, one everything is set and done, everything probed, one at last devotes oneself to the production of fine arts—perforce underlain by a life of piety and contemplation.

95

The vast vacuous territorial planes,
The pride of Faustus, the figure of nationalism.
There later men are lost in the fields of Nihil,
Estranged from Eucharist, with a wretched autonomy.

96

The (primary) reciprocal banter of instruments.

97

Most of everything in man’s life is divertissement, excepting God.

98

All those people that came creeping out the shadows, and that make up the barbaric denouement of modernity, wholly unlike the rule of reason, autonomy and liberty: in modern time they were brought up by the false messianic impulse of the elect group of arrogant saviors.

99

I am a lover of classical music, albeit I eschew physical instruments: their physicality weights down the spirit that just wants to compose and fly.

100

The world is made out of shadows, those blind motives that lack substance, since they are unbeknownst mimetic, not critically determined. In other words, they are a religious phenomena, and this is precisely why, as Marx observed, criticism proper is borne in the criticism of religion. These shadows, these blind and spell-bound motives, made out the culture, the structures and the institutions of this world—especially so in the democratic age.

101

Being powerful is burdensome, for methinks one has to ever fret about the province of one’s might.

102

The word responsibility comes from the word respond, and relates to a reciprocal response. Responsibility relates to the maintenance of the grace and charity of primary human reciprocity.

103

The first premise: mimetic fray, or competiting, educes efforts that would otherwise slumber. When I am surrounded by other intellectuals, I am motivated to learn more than others; when in a musical environment, I feel the pressure to improve my playing skill and become a virtuoso; in the market I want to reap the most profit, etcetera. The second premise: whatever comes from being plunged in the mimetic welter is by and large vanity, pretense, amour de soi, inauthenticity, pride, vain ambition, etcetera. Ergo, building upon the two premises, any strained competitive effort is wickedness—classroom, schoolmates, the market competition, sports, athletics, etcetera, etcetera ... in general, modernity itself.

104

The idealist does not experience as contradictory that his life consists of a contradiction between the absolute freedom of the ideal realm and the total dependence in the concrete, prosaic, political, economic life. On the other hand there is the man of the world, who can see this contradiction more clearly, since the former’s raptures in the absolute freedom of the ideal can be only comprehended as inseperable from the worldly freedom (political, economic, pragmatic, etcetera). The latter are all marxists.

105

Nation-state is a gnostic heresy. For the spirit there is only polis.

106

Intellectual irresponsibility—the great modern illness—is the father of most riotous tumults.

107

Is technology a gnostic enterprise founded on alchemy?

108

After the Protestant trap of the right of private interpretation, from which escape becomes impossible, the only salvation left is for the individual to assent through strictly individual spiritual and intellectual effort to the self-arrived-at understanding of the necessity of conforming to the objective authority. St. Augustine said, “I would not believe in the Gospel, if the authority of the Church did not make me believe it.”

109

He was so learned, but even after 3,600 years he could still not understand the tenth commandment.

110

Estranged from Eucharist,
Left waywardly wandering 
On the darkling plain: the 
Infamous opium-eater!

111

The truth is patient suffering, typified in Christ’s Passion. This is the gift God gave to humanity.

112

They call “genius” he who tends his own outside the chained mimetic patterns, and Oh! when his patterns exude holy divergence, holy eccentricity, a pattern divergent along the Empyrean. The impossible became a workaday easitude.

113

History is God’s dramaturgy, an eschatological drama.

114

Paltry artists merely reflect their contemporary milieu, both its virtues and ills, but more likely the latter. The finest works in human history bear the mark of a mind that is illuminated by the light of ages past (and every such mind pressuposes a certain God-seeing life). Sometimes, this light may be so strong that it can even overcome the hardships of being immersed in a dark age. There is no excuse that one was not born in quattrocento Italy; look at the heroic struggle of Petrarch, who had the resolve to sow the seeds of renaissance all by his own. 

115

Christ was a neoplatonist by intuition.

116

Patience is the nerves that endure the painful strains of waiting.

117

In vast air they breathe immortaly,
Unknowing sin or grief, content to Be.
Oriental oblivion of fools!
The Occidental nightmare resumes.

118

Fear is the slayer of curiosity.
