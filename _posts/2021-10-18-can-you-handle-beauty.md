> There lives within the very flame of love  
> A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;  
> And nothing is at a like goodness still,  
> For goodness, growing to a plurisy,  
> Dies in his own too-much.

— Act IV. Sc. VII; Hamlet

This goes trough my mind when I see a fallen and glutted spirit: this creature has been unable to handle beauty, it thus relapsed to mediocre tamed/S-E pleasure, that colossally lamentable condition of insensitivity to the bare and simple beauty of life. The virulent intoxication with hypersensory stimuli that tames the faculty and sensitivity to appreciate life. 

They find fault in not being fortunate etc.. but God has freely given so much abundance to each, and how overabundantly! He made them ‘*free to stand, and free to fall.* With each such creature there must then been a situation where it has overdone the blissful experience of beauty, lapsing to mediocre pleasure. 

The aesthetic tact requires almost an ascetic discipline and restraint, for who can handle the beautiful? True beauty and truth are both deadly. And these creatures cannot handle either of the two, so they relapse and fall off the tree of life like spoiled fruit.
