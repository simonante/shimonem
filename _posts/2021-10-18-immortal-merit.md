One of the most extraordinary experiences is to ex post see in history how an artist — immersed in then what now seems an atavistic primary movement — erect fine atemporality. For instance, it is thus marvelous to behold such untimely artefact in black and white photography. It is not a coincidence that such a rare spirits are compelled to unfold in clarity simplicity. They are as if undisturbed by the local false “complexities,“ immune to their lures and contagion.

Art is not a hackneyed stereotype coupled with poisonous associations of “art” objects. It is rather a primary mode of assembling “parts” where “parts” disappear, and thus coincide with all vital activity of life, and not just that sorry little coterie we associate with “art”. 

To me, fine art is life itself. At it’s flowering it means to assembly “parts” solely before God [ and none else, especially not the contemporary primary currents! For else a malaise of complexity, vanity and false differences destroys one’s work, making it yet another vogue artefact bound to mortality ] such that a primary symphony is assembled, making the “parts” dissapear.

To lapse either to the camp of arid tech engineers or vain sole-artist would be to err colossaly — frankly and fortunately I have grown incapable of this, _to death_. All in life needs art as I’ve tried to describe this mode above.
